<h2>Annotation of GO Identifiers to GO Terms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set gives mappings between GO identifiers and their respective terms.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each GO identifier is mapped to a <code>GOTerms</code> object that has 6 slots:
GOID: GO Identifier
Term: The term for that GO id
Synonym: Synonymous terms
Secondary: Secondary terms that have been merged into this term
Definition: Further definition of the GO term
Ontology: One of MF - molecular function, BP - biological
process, or CC - cellular component
</p>
<p>All the obsolete GO terms are under the nodes &quot;obsolete molecular
function&quot; (GO:0008369), &quot;obsolete cellular component&quot; (GO id
GO:0008370), and &quot;obsolete biological process&quot; (GO:0008371). Each of
these GO identifiers has a group of GO identifiers as their direct children with GO
terms that were defined by GO but are
deprecated in the current build. These deprecated GO terms were
appended by &quot;(obsolete)&quot; when the data package was built. 
</p>
<p>Mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
# Convert the object to a list
xx &lt;- as.list(GOTERM)
if(length(xx) &gt; 0){
    # Get the TERMS for the first elent of xx
    GOID(xx[[1]])
    Term(xx[[1]])
    Synonym(xx[[1]])
    Secondary(xx[[1]])
    Definition(xx[[1]])
    Ontology(xx[[1]])
}
