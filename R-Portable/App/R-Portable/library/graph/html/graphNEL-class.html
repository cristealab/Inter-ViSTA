<h2>Class &quot;graphNEL&quot;</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a class of graphs that are represented in terms of nodes and
an edge list. This is a suitable representation for a graph with a
large number of nodes and relatively few edges.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>graphNEL</code> class provides a very general structure for
representing graphs. It will be reasonably efficient for lists with
relatively more nodes than edges.  Although this representation can
support multi-edges, such support is not implemented and instances
of <code>graphNEL</code> are assumed to be simple graphs with at most one
edge between any pair of nodes.
</p>
<p>The <code>edgeL</code> is a named <code>list</code> of the same length as the
node vector. The names are the names of the nodes. Each element of
<code>edgeL</code> is itself a list. Each element of this (sub)list is a
vector (all must be the same length) and each element represents an
edge to another node. The sublist named <code>edges</code> holds index
values into the node vector. And each such entry represents an edge
from the node which has the same name as the component of
<code>edgeL</code> to the node with index provided. Another component that
is often used is named <code>weights</code>. It represents edge weights.
The user can specify any other edge attributes (such as types
etc). They are responsible for any special handling that
these might require.
</p>
<p>For an <code>undirected</code> instance all edges are reciprocated (there
is an edge from A to B and from B to A).
</p>
<p>Note that the reason for using indices to represent the <code>to</code> end
of a node is so that we can easily support permutation of the node
labels as a way to generate randomizations of the graph.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>nodes</code>:</dt><dd><p>Object of class <code>"vector"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>edgeL</code>:</dt><dd><p>Object of class <code>"list"</code>. The <code>edgeL</code>
must be the same length as <code>nodes</code>. The elements of this
vector correspond to the same element in <code>nodes</code>. The
elements are themselves lists. If the node has any edges then this
list will have an element named <code>edges</code>.  This will
eventually change.  Since edge weights are now stored in the
edge attributes construct, we do not need the extra level of
list.
